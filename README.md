# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game offers both a 3x3 and a 9x9 version, with options for player vs player and player vs AI modes. In the 9x9 version, players must win three small 3x3 boards in a row, while playing in the small board decided by the previous player's move.

## Features

- 3x3 and 9x9 board sizes
- Player vs player and player vs AI modes
- Two different AI models to choose from
- Wild card options, including extra turn, over-write, and swap all places
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices

## Installation

To play the game, simply visit [anas029.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe](https://anas029.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe) in your web browser. No installation is necessary.

## Usage

To play the game, select your desired board size and game mode from the options provided on the main menu. In player vs player mode, players take turns placing their marks on the board until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

In player vs AI mode, you can choose from three different AI models to play against. The AI will make its moves automatically, and you can use wild card options to gain an advantage over your opponent.

In the 9x9 version of the game, players must win three small boards in a row, while playing in the small board decided by the previous player's move. If the small board decided by the previous player's move has already been won or resulted in a draw, the next player can play in any available small board within the larger 3x3 grid.
